# PriorityQueue
## Project description:

The project is written in C++ and aims to implement a custom priority queue and split user-entered messages into packets, which are then stored in files.

##Program Operation
Upon starting the program, the user is prompted to enter a message and provide the number of packets they want to divide it into. 
The program then splits the message into packets of equal length and saves each of them in a file named "Wn", where "n" is the next iteration.
The next step is to add previously created packets to the priority queue in a random order, where the priority is the message number. 
The user can choose to display the messages in the order in which they were added to the queue or in an order sorted by priorities.

## What do you need to open this program?
The project uses standard C++ libraries and works on multiple platforms. The source code contains detailed comments and user instructions.

## Conclusion
The user can use this project to learn how a priority queue works and how to implement it.
The project can also be expanded with additional features, such as displaying the queue in a different order or deleting elements from the queue.
